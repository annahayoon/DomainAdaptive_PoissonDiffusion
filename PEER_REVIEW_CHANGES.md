# Peer Review: Side-by-Side Comparison

## Executive Summary

**Core Issue:** The training script was violating separation of concerns by mixing training logic with domain-specific concerns that should be handled in preprocessing and inference.

**Core Fix:** Simplify training to be unconditional diffusion on generic tensors. Move all domain-specific logic (labels, sensor parameters, Bayer handling) to where it belongs:
- **Before training**: Preprocessing pipeline
- **After training**: Inference with physics-informed guidance

## Issue #1: Unconditional Training (Not Class-Conditional)

### ❌ BEFORE - WRONG

```python
dataset_kwargs = dict(
    class_name="data.dataset.EDMPTDataset",
    data_root=args.data_root,
    metadata_json=args.metadata_json,
    split="train",
    image_size=args.img_resolution,
    channels=args.channels,
    domain=None,  # Auto-detect from metadata
    use_labels=True,           # ❌ WRONG - Makes model class-conditional
    label_dim=3,               # ❌ WRONG - For what classes?
    data_range="normalized",
    max_size=None,
)
```

**Problem:**
- `use_labels=True` forces the model to expect class labels
- Makes the model class-conditional: P(x|label), not P(x)
- But image restoration doesn't need class labels!
- The model should be unconditional, learning P(x) = distribution of clean images
- Guidance (conditioning) happens at inference, not training

### ✅ AFTER - CORRECT

```python
dataset_kwargs = dict(
    class_name="data.dataset.SimplePTDataset",
    data_root=args.data_root,
    metadata_json=args.metadata_json,
    split="train",
    image_size=args.img_resolution,
    channels=args.channels,
)
```

**Why This Is Right:**
- No labels needed → unconditional training
- No domain parameter → works with any preprocessed tensors
- Clean, minimal configuration → easier to understand and maintain

## Issue #2: Domain-Specific Code Doesn't Belong in Training

### ❌ BEFORE - WRONG

```python
def main():
    """Main training function for photography float32 .pt data.

    The training script expects .pt files that have been processed by the pipeline with:
    - Raw images (Sony ARW / Fuji RAF) loaded and demosaiced to RGB
    - Normalization to [0, 1] during demosaicing (black level subtraction + white level normalization)
    - Final normalization to [-1, 1] using 2 * tensor - 1 transformation
    - Metadata JSON with splits, calibration parameters, and scaling info
    """

    dataset_kwargs = dict(
        class_name="data.dataset.EDMPTDataset",
        domain="photography",  # ❌ WRONG - Training shouldn't care about domain
        use_labels=True,
        label_dim=3,
        data_range="normalized",  # ❌ WRONG - This is a preprocessing concern
        max_size=None,
    )
```

**Problems:**
1. Documentation focuses on preprocessing details (demosaicing, black level)
   - This doesn't belong in training code
   - Preprocessing is already done before training starts

2. `domain="photography"` parameter
   - Unnecessary coupling
   - Limits reusability
   - Training is actually domain-agnostic

3. `data_range="normalized"` parameter
   - Training should just assume tensors are in [-1, 1]
   - Doesn't need to verify this at training time

4. Over-engineered for simple tensor loading
   - Using complex `EDMPTDataset` class
   - When a simple dataset loader would suffice

### ✅ AFTER - CORRECT

```python
def main():
    """Main training function for unconditional diffusion on preprocessed tensors.

    The training script expects .pt files that have been preprocessed by the pipeline:
    - Raw images processed to domain-specific format (e.g., demosaicing, normalization)
    - Tensors normalized to [-1, 1] range
    - Metadata JSON with train/val splits

    All domain-specific handling (sensor calibration, Bayer packing, etc.) is
    done in preprocessing. Training is simple unconditional diffusion on clean images.
    """

    dataset_kwargs = dict(
        class_name="data.dataset.SimplePTDataset",
        data_root=args.data_root,
        metadata_json=args.metadata_json,
        split="train",
        image_size=args.img_resolution,
        channels=args.channels,
    )
```

**Why This Is Right:**
1. Documentation focuses on training contract (what we need as input)
   - Not preprocessing implementation details

2. No domain parameter
   - Can work with any preprocessed tensors
   - Photos, microscopy, astronomy, medical imaging

3. No `data_range` parameter
   - Training assumes tensors are in [-1, 1] (already done in preprocessing)

4. Simple `SimplePTDataset`
   - Just loads .pt files
   - All complexity stays in preprocessing

## Issue #3: Architecture Clarity

### ❌ BEFORE - Confusing

**The old code didn't make clear where physics-informed concerns go:**

```python
# In paper.tex, the heteroscedastic guidance formula is:
# ∇ = (y - x̂) / (x̂ + σ_r²)

# But where does σ_r come from?
# Where is (y - x̂) computed?
# The training script didn't show this, confusing the architecture
```

### ✅ AFTER - Clear Architecture

Now the code explicitly shows the separation:

```python
"""
Physics-informed guidance (heteroscedastic Poisson-Gaussian, sensor-specific
noise models) is applied at inference time, not during training.

TRAINING INPUT:
- Preprocessed .pt files containing float32 tensors in [-1, 1] range
- Clean/long-exposure images for restoration tasks
- No labels needed (unconditional training)
- No domain-specific handling required

INFERENCE (separate script):
- Load trained unconditional model
- Apply physics-informed likelihood gradients for guidance
- Use domain-specific noise models and sensor calibration
"""
```

**Architecture:**

```
RAW IMAGES (Sony ARW, Fuji RAF)
        ↓
  [PREPROCESSING] ← Domain-specific (Bayer packing, sensor calibration)
        ↓
Normalized .pt files [-1, 1] + metadata JSON
        ↓
  [TRAINING] ← Generic (unconditional diffusion)
        ↓
Trained model (P(x) distribution)
        ↓
  [INFERENCE] ← Physics-informed (heteroscedastic guidance, sensor parameters)
        ↓
Enhanced images
```

## Issue #4: Unused Import

### ❌ BEFORE

```python
from data.dataset import create_edm_pt_datasets  # ❌ Never used!
```

### ✅ AFTER

```python
from data.dataset import SimplePTDataset  # ✅ Actually used
```

---

## Issue #5: Output Directory Naming

### ❌ BEFORE

```python
default="results/edm_photography_training"
```

**Problem:** Makes it sound like photography-specific training, but it's actually domain-agnostic

### ✅ AFTER

```python
default="results/edm_diffusion_training"
```

**Better:** Reflects the actual purpose (generic diffusion model training)

---

## Issue #6: Config File Path

### ❌ BEFORE

```python
default="config/photo.yaml"
```

**Problem:** Implies photography-specific configuration

### ✅ AFTER

```python
default="config/diffusion.yaml"
```

**Better:** Reflects generic diffusion model training

---

## The Underlying Principle: Separation of Concerns

### Where Each Concern Belongs

| Concern | Location | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Raw image loading | Preprocessing | sensor/format specific |
| Bayer demosaicing | Preprocessing | sensor-specific |
| Black level subtraction | Preprocessing | sensor-specific |
| Normalization to [-1,1] | Preprocessing | must be done before training |
| Unconditional diffusion training | **Training** | generic deep learning |
| Physics-informed guidance | Inference | domain-specific mathematics |
| Heteroscedastic gradient | Inference | physics-specific |
| Read noise calibration (σ_r) | Inference | sensor-specific |

### Key Insight

**The training code doesn't need to know:**
- What type of camera captured the images
- What sensor preprocessing was done
- What the physical noise model is
- Any domain-specific details

**The training code only needs to know:**
- Load tensors in [-1, 1] range
- Train unconditional diffusion
- Save checkpoints

**All domain details live in:**
- Preprocessing (before training)
- Inference (after training)

## Code Quality Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Lines in dataset_kwargs | 8 | 6 | ✅ 25% simpler |
| Unnecessary parameters | 4 | 0 | ✅ Removed coupling |
| Unused imports | 1 | 0 | ✅ Cleaner |
| Documentation focus | preprocessing | architecture | ✅ More useful |
| Domain coupling | tight | decoupled | ✅ More reusable |
| Model type | class-conditional | unconditional | ✅ Correct for task |

---

## How This Aligns with the Paper

**From paper.tex:**

> "Train unconditional EDM prior on packed 4-channel RAW Bayer data from SID
> (following Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark preprocessing), apply our heteroscedastic
> guidance during sampling"

**This means:**
1. ✅ Preprocessing is separate (already done before training)
2. ✅ Training is unconditional (our fix)
3. ✅ Guidance is at inference (not in training, as we fixed)

**The refactored code now properly reflects this architecture.**

## Summary: What Changed and Why

| Change | Was | Now | Why |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|
| Labels | `use_labels=True` | `use_labels=False` | Unconditional training |
| Domain | `domain="photography"` | removed | domain-agnostic |
| Dataset | `EDMPTDataset` | `SimplePTDataset` | simplicity |
| Import | `create_edm_pt_datasets` | `SimplePTDataset` | no unused imports |
| Help text | "photography float32" | "preprocessed tensors" | accurate naming |
| Config path | `photo.yaml` | `diffusion.yaml` | reflects purpose |
| Output dir | `photography_training` | `diffusion_training` | reflects purpose |

---

## Next Step: Create SimplePTDataset

The code now references `SimplePTDataset`, which should implement:

```python
class SimplePTDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    """Simple dataset for loading preprocessed .pt tiles.

    Expected .pt files:
    - shape: (channels, height, width)
    - dtype: float32
    - range: [-1, 1]
    - already preprocessed (demosaiced, normalized, etc.)
    """

    def __init__(self, data_root, metadata_json, split, image_size, channels):
        """Load file list from metadata JSON for given split."""
        with open(metadata_json) as f:
            metadata = json.load(f)
        self.files = metadata[split]  # e.g., ["img_0001.pt", "img_0002.pt", ...]
        self.data_root = data_root

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        """Load single .pt file."""
        tensor = torch.load(os.path.join(self.data_root, self.files[idx]))
        # EDM expects (tensor, dict) tuples
        return tensor, {}

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.files)
```

This is clean, simple, and exactly what training needs.

## Bottom Line

**Before:** Mixed concerns, confusing architecture, unnecessary complexity
**After:** Clean separation, clear architecture, minimal complexity

This is the difference between code that "works but is confusing" and code that "works and is clear."
